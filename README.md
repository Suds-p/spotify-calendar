# Spotify Calendar (Cal)
**Cal** is a simple visualization of what songs/artists a user listened to the most over their Spotify history. Users upload JSON data files of their history (instructions on how to get these files coming soon) and the app renders a calendar view with the most listened-to song/artist on each day. Users can also choose a specific date range to view songs over.

## Preview
Mockups of the project are provided below since it is not currently hosted publicly:

## Coming Soon
